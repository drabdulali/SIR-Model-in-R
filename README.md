# SIR-Model-in-R
SIR Model for disease transmission in closed population in R


Parameters
β	is the transmission rate and incorporates the encounter rate between susceptible and infectious individuals together with the probability of transmission.
γ	is called the removal or recovery rate, though often we are more interested in its reciprocal (1/γ) which determines the average infectious period.
S(0)	is the initial proportion of the population that are susceptible.
I(0)	is the initial proportion of the population that are infectious.
